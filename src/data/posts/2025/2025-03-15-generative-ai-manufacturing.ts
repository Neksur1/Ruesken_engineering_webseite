      <p>The integration of Generative AI into manufacturing sectors is marking the beginning of a new industrial revolution. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced neural networks, factories are moving beyond simple automation to genuine autonomy.</p>
      
      <h3>Predictive Maintenance 2.0</h3>
      <p>Traditional predictive maintenance relied on static thresholds. Generative models now analyze vibration, thermal, and acoustic patterns in real-time, predicting failures before they manifest with unprecedented accuracy. This shift reduces downtime by an estimated 40% in pilot programs.</p>

      <h3>Generative Design</h3>
      <p>Beyond maintenance, AI is reshaping the very components we manufacture. Generative design algorithms can iterate through thousands of structural variations in minutes, optimizing for weight and strength in ways human engineers might overlook. This is particularly revolutionary in aerospace and automotive industries where every gram counts.</p>

      <p>The future isn't just about robots building cars; it's about systems that understand the physics of their own existence and optimize their operations autonomously.</p>
