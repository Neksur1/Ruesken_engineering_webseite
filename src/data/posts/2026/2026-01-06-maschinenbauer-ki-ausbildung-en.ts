      <p>German mechanical engineering companies are sounding the alarm: while Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly important for the sectore, they consider universities to be insufficiently prepared for training young engineers. According to a current survey by the industry association VDMA, 86 percent of the companies surveyed consider AI skills to be important. At the same time, only 23 percent rate the preparation of junior staff in this field as good, while 49 percent classify the training as poor or rather poor.</p>

      <p>Around 400 companies from the mechanical and plant engineering sector took part in the survey. The results show a major gap between the requirements of the industry and university education. "An essential basis of our innovative strength threatens to erode," commented Hartmut Rauen, Deputy Executive Director of the VDMA. This warning comes at a time when 71 percent of the companies surveyed continue to report bottlenecks in the search for suitable candidates.</p>

      <h3>Labor market remains tense</h3>
      <p>Despite the difficult situation, the majority of mechanical engineers plan to keep or even expand their engineering positions. In smaller companies with up to 500 employees, 77 percent want to keep the number of their engineers stable and 17 percent even want to expand. In larger firms, 56 percent assume a stable development, while 18 percent want to hire additional engineers. A similar trend can be seen for skilled workers.</p>

      <p>According to the VDMA, the shortage of skilled workers has a noticeable impact on the competitiveness of the industry. Above all, large companies are increasingly planning the expansion of research and development abroad, according to the survey. This could weaken Germany as a location for innovation in the long term.</p>

      <h3>AI degree programs as an answer</h3>
      <p>Specialized degree programs that combine AI and engineering sciences are already being created at several German universities. Calculate Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, together with four universities in Saxony-Anhalt, offers the degree program "AI Engineering – Artificial Intelligence in Engineering Sciences". The Technical University of Mannheim and the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences have also started corresponding programs. Whether these initiatives are sufficient to cover the needs of the industry remains to be seen.</p>
